An easy, fast, and robust library to parse C/C++ source.

## Features
- No pre-processing, and preprocessors are part of the ast.
- Most comments are preserved too.
- Developed from scratch and uses back-tracking yacc (BtYacc) to write C++ grammer, that means **no dependency on libclang**.
- The result of parsing is an AST where elements of a file are arranged in a tree.
- Minimum dependency. Only external dependency is a [lexer](https://github.com/westes/flex) which is by default available on unix like platforms and can be easily [get on Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm).
- Parsing of multi-file program is supported too.

## Motivation 
CppParser can be used to build tools that need parsing of C/C++ files.
I am using it to develop [cib](https://github.com/satya-das/cib/) which implements ABI stable SDK architecture for C++ library.

## Example

To begin with we will see an example of parsing a hello-world program and see what is the AST that `CppParser` creates:
!INCLUDECODE "test/unit/test-files/hello-world.cpp" (c++)

For the above hello-world program we can expect that when it is parsed the generated AST should look like following:
![AST for Hello World program](https://github.com/satya-das/cppparser/blob/master/src/readme-assets/HelloWorldAST.svg "AST for Hello World program")

So, how we are going to access these elements of AST using `CppParser`?
Below is the program written as unit-test for validating the correctness of generated AST:

!INCLUDECODE "test/unit/test-hello-world.cpp" (c++)

**This example is a real one and is part of actual unit test of CppParser**.

## Building CppParser

### Get the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/satya-das/common.git
git clone https://github.com/satya-das/CppParser.git
```

## Configure and build

```sh
cd cppparser
mkdir builds
cd builds
cmake ..
make && make test
```

*Alternatively, if you prefer `Ninja` instead of `make`*:

```sh
cd cppparser
mkdir builds
cd builds
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja && ninja test
```
