# Why we build BtYacc #
We use BtYacc but since no "official" binary release is available (at-least for windows) we build it on our own.

We do no modification in BtYacc sources but we create our project files to help us build it easily.

Files in btyacc folder are downloaded from internet but we may pull sources from https://github.com/ChrisDodd/btyacc.git in future. It appears to be actively maintained but it is having some nasty bug and is not working for us.
